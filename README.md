## CodeCraft Jr.

Welcome to CodeCraft Jr.! The perfect app to guide your kids on the path of programming. 

The app is based on brief exercises with drag and drop puzzles, sending instructions to a character and reaching the goal. Navigate through zig-zags and loop-de-loops with directional blocks. Its game-like nature will make learning as entertaining as possible. All in a familiar theme. ;) 

## How to use

Operating CodeCraft Jr. couldn't be simpler. 

Adults can log in with an account and view their kids' activity in the game.
(Note for testers: the sample account has a first name of sample and password sample!)

Kids just select their profile, select a level option, and off they go! 

## The game itself

Directional blocks are dragged down to the bottom hotbar. You can place a maximum of 9. The player character will go in this direction until he hits a wall.

When all the directional blocks you desire are placed, simply press the GO block on the left to execute your code. 

Didn't work out? No problem. Clear the hotbar with the CLEAR block, and try dragging blocks again. Press GO again when you feel you are ready, and the character will start again from the beginning.

Get to the rightmost side of the playfield to win! When you are ready, press the EXIT block to go to the level menu.

### 3 Bonus Features
1. Scalable to phone and tablet

   CodeCraft Jr. Will work just fine on any modern Android device, no matter the screen size. Here is a screenshot of it running on a Pixel Tablet - observe how all the UI elements scale to fill the screen.

3. Level generator

   Aside from the normal levels, CodeCraft Jr. can procedurally generate **thousands** of random levels, increasing replay value for a long time! No, these are not pre-made! They are constructed on the fly every time you press the play button. You could make a new maze every day for years!
  
4. Hard mode

   This creates more complex levels without straightforward paths to test the player's skill.
   This is a normal level:

   And this is a hard mode level!
